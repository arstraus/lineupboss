## Frequently Asked Questions

### Account Management

#### How does the login system work?
LineupBoss uses a modern authentication system that allows you to stay logged in across sessions for convenience while maintaining security. When you log in, the system creates a secure token that is stored on your device. This token automatically refreshes in the background as you use the application, so you won't need to log in frequently.

#### Will I stay logged in between sessions?
Yes! LineupBoss is designed to keep you logged in even when you close your browser or turn off your device. Your login session will remain active for up to 15 days of inactivity. As long as you use the application at least once within that period, your session will automatically extend.

#### Why am I sometimes asked to log in again?
You might be asked to log in again in these situations:
- You haven't used LineupBoss for more than 15 days
- You've manually logged out
- You've cleared your browser data or cookies
- There was a security update that required re-authentication
- You're accessing from a new device or browser

#### Is it safe to stay logged in?
Yes, our authentication system is designed with security in mind. Each login session uses encrypted tokens that are regularly refreshed. For shared or public computers, we recommend logging out manually when you're finished using the application.

#### How do I log out?
You can log out at any time by clicking on your profile icon in the top-right corner of the screen, then selecting "Log out" from the dropdown menu. This will immediately end your session.
